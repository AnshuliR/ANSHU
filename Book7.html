        <p class="h4">Collector's Edition with Audiobook read by the Author, Stephen Hawking is widely believed to be one of the world's greatest minds, a brilliant theoretical physicist whose work helped to reconfigure models of the universe and to redefine what's in it. Imagine sitting in a room listening to Hawking discuss these achievements and place them in historical context. It would be like hearing Christopher Columbus on the New World. Hawking presents a series of seven lectures, covering everything from big bang to black holes to string theory, that capture not only the brilliance of Hawking's mind but his characteristic wit as well.</p>
